                            Although we do not have our own ambulance, we provide primary care as first responders while the unit arrives to continue the care. We have Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) and advanced equipment to assist in critical situations. Our priority is to stabilize patients and ensure their well-being. We are also present at events, guaranteeing immediate attention to any medical emergency.
